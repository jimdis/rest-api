## Assignment report

### HATEOAS

All JSON response bodies from the API have a \_links field. Lists have a \_links field in each item. The field contains key/value pairs with a description and url for self and related resources. By making a GET request to the root of the API Links are provided to each endpoint. The format is perhaps not very "wordy" with href and name properties etc, but I think it's simple, self-explanatory and sufficient for this relatively small API, and makes it easy to "browse" the api.

### Multiple representations

_If your solution were to implement multiple representations of the resources. How would you do it?_

### Autentication

_Motivate and defend your authentication solution. What other authentication solutions could you implement? What pros/cons do this solution have?_

### Webhooks

_Explain how your webhook works_

### Further improvments

_Since this is your first own web API, there are probably things you would solve in another way, looking back at this assignment. Write your thoughts about this._

### Extras

_Did you do something extra besides the fundamental requirements? Explain them._

### Feedback

_Feedback to the course management about the assignment._
